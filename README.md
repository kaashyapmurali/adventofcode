# Advent of Code Solutions

This repo contains my working solutions for https://adventofcode.com puzzles, organized by year and day. To get the actual input for a puzzle, sign in on the Advent of Code website and copy your input from the puzzle page.

### Notes
- Each day's solution is the `run.py` file inside that day's folder.
- `input.txt` is typically the real input
- `test_input.txt` contains test cases / examples used while developing
- To run a solution:
  - `cd` into the day's folder and run the python file:
```
cd adventofcode/2025/day5
python run.py
```
